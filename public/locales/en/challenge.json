      "declining": "If the challenge is not averted, the fixed price phase is followed by a declining price phase during which the price at which the {{symbol}} tokens can be obtained declines linearly towards zero. In this case, the challenge is considered successful and you get the provided {{symbol}} tokens back. The tokens sold in this phase do not come from the challenger, but from the position owner. The total amount of tokens that can be bought from the position is limited by the amount left in the challenge at the end of the fixed price phase. As a reward for starting a successful challenge, you get 2% of the sales proceeds."
