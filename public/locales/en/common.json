      "buffer":
      "The retained reserve is the portion of the collateral that is set aside to ensure the stability of the position and the overall system. When opening a new position to mint Oracle Free Dollar (OFD), the retained reserve acts as a safety net to cover potential losses and mitigate risks associated with market volatility.This reserve is calculated based on the reserve requirement and is important for maintaining confidence in the system, especially during challenges or liquidations. It helps ensure that there are sufficient funds available to manage any adverse situations that may arise.",

      "The liquidation price is the threshold value at which a position will be liquidated if the market price of the collateral falls below it. When opening a new position to mint Oracle Free Dollar (OFD), you can set the liquidation price freely, but it must ensure that the position can be liquidated for at least a minimum amount (e.g., 3,500 OFD).This price is crucial as it helps protect the system from losses by ensuring that the collateral can cover the minted OFD in case of a market downturn.",
      "maturity":
      "The maturity refers to the duration for which the position is set when opening a new position to mint Oracle Free Dollar (OFD). It defines the time period until the position expires, which can be set between today and the limit date (one year from the date the parent position was minted).The maturity period affects the annual interest charged, as shorter maturities will result in a different final interest amount.",
